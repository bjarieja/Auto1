 * @details
 * Rundenzaehler fuer die Carrera-Bahn
 * This implementation demonstrates wireless LED control through a smartphone app
 * using the RemoteXY library. The system establishes Bluetooth communication
 * via SoftwareSerial (pins 10/RX, 11/TX) and provides a simple interface with
 * one button widget to toggle an LED connected to pin 13. The solution shows
 * basic RemoteXY integration patterns that can be expanded for more complex
 * IoT control applications. The LED state changes immediately when the virtual
 * button is pressed in the mobile app, with status feedback provided through
 * both the hardware LED and app interface.
