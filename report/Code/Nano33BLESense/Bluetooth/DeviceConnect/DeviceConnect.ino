/**
 * @file NanoRFID_BLE.cpp
 * @brief BLE peripheral example sending a fixed string "hello" to a central device.
 * 
 * This sketch initializes an Arduino BLE peripheral that advertises a custom service
 * and characteristic. When a central device connects (e.g., nRF Connect app), it receives
 * the string "hello" in the characteristic. The RFID reading code is included but inactive.
 * 
 * Hardware:
 * - Arduino Nano 33 BLE or compatible BLE board
 * - MFRC522 RFID module (SPI pins: SS_PIN = 10, RST_PIN = 9)
