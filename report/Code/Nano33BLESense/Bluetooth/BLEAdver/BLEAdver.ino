 * @brief Basic example for starting BLE advertising with ArduinoBLE.
 * 
 * This example initializes the BLE hardware, sets a local device name, 
 * and starts advertising over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is useful 
 * for testing if the device is visible to BLE scanners (e.g., smartphone apps).
 * 
 * @details
 * - Board: Arduino Nano 33 BLE or compatible
 * - Library: ArduinoBLE
 * - Function: Start BLE advertising with the name "TestBLE"
 * 
 * @version 1.0
