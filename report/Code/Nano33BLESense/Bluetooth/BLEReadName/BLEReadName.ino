 * @brief BLE Advertising and Central Device Connection Logger
 * 
 * This sketch initializes BLE on a compatible Arduino board, 
 * starts advertising with a local device name, and detects when 
 * a central device connects. It logs the central devices BLE address 
 * and reports when the connection is closed.
 * 
 * @details
 * - Board: Arduino Nano 33 BLE or compatible
 * - Library: ArduinoBLE
 * - Functionality:
 *   - Start BLE advertising with the name "TestBLE"
 *   - Detect and log connections from central BLE devices
 * 
 * @version 1.0
