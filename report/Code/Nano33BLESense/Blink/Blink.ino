 * @brief Simple example to blink the on-board LED on and off.
 * 
 * @details
 * Turns the built-in LED on for one second, then off for one second repeatedly.
 * Most Arduino boards have a built-in LED connected to a specific digital pin.
 * The macro LED_BUILTIN is used to ensure compatibility across different boards.
 * 
 * @note For more details about your board's built-in LED, see:
